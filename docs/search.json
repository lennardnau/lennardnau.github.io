[Abstract]\n\n\n\nElite connections shape political and economic outcomes but are difficult to measure. Traditional methods rely on surveys or shared affiliations, which lack scalability and clear interpretation. We propose a scalable, interpretable approach to map elite networks by compiling elite lists, detecting co-appearances in media, coding interactions with large language models (LLMs), and constructing network ties. This complements conventional methods and suits dynamic elite politics. Applied to Germany (2013–2023), our data includes 750 parliamentarians and 1,051 top executives. We collected 42,366 articles from 30 newspapers, identifying co-appearances. Open-source LLMs code interactions such as meetings or conversations, enabling nuanced network definitions. We validate networks qualitatively and quantitatively by linking them to events like elections and comparing them with education-based networks. This method expands elite network research beyond typical scopes, offering scalable, interpretable insights into how political and economic elites connect and influence each other."

[Abstract]  [Research article]\n\n\nThe discovery of power laws in conflict intensities has spurred numerous explanation attempts. Two different interpretations have persisted: the notion that power laws are spurious results of random processes and the opposing view that power-law distributions attest to endogenous dynamics linked to self-organized criticality (SOC). We substantiate the SOC forest-fire model for intrastate conflicts, conceptualizing conflict potential as social pressure, measured by horizontal inequality. This potential is triggered by infinitesimal events. Their occurrence depends on the interaction density between conflict actors, operationalized as the conjunction of state capacity and non-state governance. In a global analysis of 143 conflict dyads, we find that 40 conform to a power law and 33 to a stretched exponential distribution, the two outcomes predicted by the model. We find evidence that the forest-fire model is a plausible approximation of the dynamics of intrastate conflicts, accounting for both the conformity and the non-conformity to power laws.\n\n\n Towards Genuine Collaboration in International Research, with Nora Chirikure.Published in WZB Mitteilungen 184, 2024 .

Nora Chirikure and Lennard Naumann explore what is needed to establish truly equitable South-North research partnerships and to ensure the success of research originating from the Global South.\n\n\n Attributing agnostically detected large reductions in road CO2 emissions to policy mixes (with Nicolas Koch, Felix Pretis, Nolan Ritter, and Moritz Schwarz).Published in Nature Energy 7, 2022 .    [Abstract]  [Research article]\n\n\nPolicymakers combine many different policy tools to achieve emission reductions. However, there remains substantial uncertainty around which mixes of policies are effective. This uncertainty stems from the predominant focus of ex post policy evaluation on isolating effects of single, known policies. Here we introduce an approach to identify effective policy interventions in the EU road transport sector by detecting treatment effects as structural breaks in CO2 emissions that can potentially occur in any country at any point in time from any number of a priori unknown policies. This search for ‘causes of effects’ within a statistical framework allows us to draw systematic inference on the effectiveness of policy mixes. We detect ten successful policy interventions that reduced emissions between 8% and 26%. The most successful policy mixes combine carbon or fuel taxes with green vehicle incentives and highlight that emissions reductions on a magnitude that matches the EU zero emission targets are possible."
