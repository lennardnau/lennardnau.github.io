Hi! I'm a a researcher in the [*Institutions and Political Inequality* unit at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/political-economy-of-development/institutions-and-political-inequality), and an affiliated member ofÂ the Research Training Group [*The Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy* (DYNAMICS)](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics). My work focuses on intergroup relations, prejudice, and outgroup avoidance, using experimental and quasi-experimental methods. In addition, I am interested in webscraping and the use of Large Language Models (LLM) in the social sciences. Feel free to get in touch: lennard\[dot\]naumann\[at\]wzb\[dot\]eu
